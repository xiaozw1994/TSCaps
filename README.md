# TSCaps : Time Series Capsules
In this repo, we introduce it from four parts : first to introduce the dataset and how to download dataset, second to discuss the environments you need, third to disscuss the sturcture of this paper and how to train, and finally to introduce our experiments.
## Dataset
In our experiments, we use the UCR time series achive to evaluate our model, which it includes 128 vary datasets and its details are shown at http://www.timeseriesclassification.com . 
Here you can download dataset from the official websites or [my baidu Cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1OY-G7YBD4osHrfg6PaIczA), which its key is 8u8u.
## Environments
The codes of this repo are tested on Python 3.6 and Tensorflow 1.13. First you must install some API your computers need. You can do as follows.
```
        pip3 install --user -r irequest.txt or sudo pip3 install -r request.txt
        python2: you can change pip3 into pip .
```
